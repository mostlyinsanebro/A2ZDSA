Solution:-
Keep two counters, count and maxcount , now traverse the array, if the element is 1, increase the count by 1 and compare the count
with maxcount, if count is > maxcount, then update the maxcount by count. If the element is 0, then make the count as 0 again.

T.C. -> O(n)
S.C. -> O(1)

Code:-
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {

        int c=0,mc=0;

        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            if(nums[i]==1)
            {
                c++;
                if(c > mc)
                {
                    mc = c;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                c = 0;
            }   
        }
        return mc;
        
    }
}
